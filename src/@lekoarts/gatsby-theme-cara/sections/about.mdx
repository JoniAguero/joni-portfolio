## About

I consider myself a persistent and dreamy person. I am passionate about the entrepreneurial world, and I found in programming, the perfect ally for the execution of ideas.

In these years I have worked on various projects, both professionally and in others that have been of interest to me, most of them using Javascript.

I am a person who likes to be in continuous training, acquiring new skills, reinforcing knowledge or learning new technologies.
